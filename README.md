# LM-V500N-Spoofer
LM-V500 Spoofer is a flashable module from Magisk that modifies the information on your device so that it identifies as an LG V50 ThinQ. Its main objective is to solve possible identification problems when using GSIs, such as Evolution X, which alter the device model and can generate incompatibilities with specific applications, such as GCam.
