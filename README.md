# LM-V500 Spoofer

LM-V500 Spoofer is a Magisk-flashable module designed to modify your device's identity to appear as an LG V50 ThinQ. Its primary purpose is to address identification issues when using GSIs (Generic System Images), such as Evolution X, that may alter the device model. These changes can lead to incompatibilities with specific applications, like GCam.
